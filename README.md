  <h3>I'm Joni Ronimus, a student on a quest to make every day better than the last. While my formal education journey is still in progress, I'm already passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</h3>
  
  
  
  Professional Mission: My mantra is simple: "Good is not enough." I strive to raise the bar and improve in everything I do, whether it's in the classroom or in my extracurricular adventures.
  
  Interests: When I'm not hitting the books, you'll find me scoring goals in the virtual world of video games, hitting the pavement for a jog, sinking balls on the snooker table, or passionately following football action both live and on screens.
  
  Fun Fact: Here's a slice of nostalgia for you â€“ when I was a kid, my dad and I embarked on a legendary road trip from Finland to Paris in search of the world's most unexpected culinary experience: pizza in the city of love! Paris might not be famous for its pizza, but it's now a part of my unforgettable story.
  
  Get in Touch: Have a question, an idea, or just want to say hi? Don't be shy! Visit the contact part of my portfolio site, and let's chat. I'm all ears for a good conversation.
  
  Let's make every day an adventure worth remembering, one smile and one step at a time. ðŸš€
